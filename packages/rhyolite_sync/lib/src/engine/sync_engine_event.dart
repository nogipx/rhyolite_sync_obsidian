/// Generic envelope for server-side rejections that originate from

///
/// This is the OCP escape hatch: new business rules added on the
/// server reach the consumer via this single event type, identified by
/// a stable hierarchical [code]. Adding a new policy never requires
/// editing `rhyolite_sync` — the server emits a new code, the consumer
/// pattern-matches on it.
///
/// Standard codes (embedders may define more):
///
/// - `auth.session_expired` — refresh token invalid; user must re-sign-in.
///   The engine stops after emitting this code.
/// - `auth.permission_denied` — caller does not own the vault.
/// - `app_policy.subscription_required` — no active subscription. The
///   engine stops after emitting this code.
/// - `app_policy.quota.<dimension>` — quota exceeded
///   (e.g. `app_policy.quota.storage`, `app_policy.quota.file_size`,
///   `app_policy.quota.vault_count`, `app_policy.quota.daily_bandwidth`).
/// - `app_policy.rate.<dimension>` — rate-limited
///   (e.g. `app_policy.rate.push`, `app_policy.rate.pull`).
/// - `feature.<name>` — generic feature-level signal from the server
///   (e.g. `feature.external_blob_config_discovered` carries the
///   discovered config in [params] under key `config`).
///
/// [params] carries structured data the consumer can render
/// (e.g. `{current: 5368709120, limit: 5368709120}` for storage
/// quota, or `{config: {...}}` for external blob config).
///
/// ## Typed subclasses (recommended)
///
/// This class is intentionally **not** `final`, so consumers can define
/// typed subclasses for the codes they care about and have switch
/// statements pattern-match on the type instead of the string code:
///
/// ```dart
/// // Defined in your app code, not in rhyolite_sync:
/// class SessionExpired extends SyncServerRejected {
///   SessionExpired(String message)
///     : super(code: 'auth.session_expired', message: message);
/// }
///
/// class StorageQuotaExceeded extends SyncServerRejected {
///   StorageQuotaExceeded({
///     required this.currentBytes,
///     required this.limitBytes,
///     required String message,
///   }) : super(
///     code: 'app_policy.quota.storage',
///     message: message,
///     params: {'current': '$currentBytes', 'limit': '$limitBytes'},
///   );
///   final int currentBytes;
///   final int limitBytes;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Then wire a [ServerRejectionFactory] into the engine constructor so
/// the engine emits typed instances instead of the raw envelope:
///
/// ```dart
/// final engine = StateSyncEngine(
///   ...,
///   rejectionFactory: (code, message, params) => switch (code) {
///     'auth.session_expired' => SessionExpired(message),
///     'app_policy.quota.storage' => StorageQuotaExceeded(
///       currentBytes: int.parse(params['current'] ?? '0'),
///       limitBytes: int.parse(params['limit'] ?? '0'),
///       message: message,
///     ),
///     _ => null, // unknown code → engine emits raw SyncServerRejected
///   },
/// );
///
/// engine.events.listen((event) {
///   switch (event) {
///     case StorageQuotaExceeded(:final currentBytes, :final limitBytes):
///       showStorageDialog(currentBytes, limitBytes);   // typed!
///     case SessionExpired():
///       refreshTokenAndRestart();
///     case SyncServerRejected(:final code):
///       log.info('unknown rejection: $code');           // fallback
